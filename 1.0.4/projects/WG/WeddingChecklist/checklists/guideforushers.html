<h2>A Guide for Ushers</h2>
<p>Congratulations, you have been selected to represent the bridegroom and bride as an Usher,
an invaluable attendant which should be considered an honor. Here are a few guidelines to follow
and some traditional instructions which may be helpful to you in fulfilling your new role. No two
weddings are identical. The information provided is to guide you concerning accepted Usher
procedures, and in no way should interfere with the wedding plans which have been described by
the bride or wedding consultant.
One of the most important things to remember is that your manner which should be friendly,
polite and cheerful, will have a contagious effect on the entire atmosphere of the wedding. It goes
without saying that you must be well-groomed, on time, and well acquainted with the responsibilities
you have for this important occasion. In many cases, Ushers set the mood with their efficient ability
and exemplary dispositions.</p>

<h3>OBLIGATIONS</h3>
<ul class="no-dot">
	<li><input type="checkbox" name="_checklist_guideforushers_1" /> An Usher attends the bachelor party and contributes to a joint gift which is presented to the
bridegroom at the party. This gift is separate from the individual wedding present given to the
couple by each Usher and Best Man.</li>
	<li><input type="checkbox" name="_checklist_guideforushers_2" /> Each Usher has the responsibility to dress according to attire and instruction of the bride
and bridegroom. Attire must be fitted properly, picked up and paid for then finally returned
when necessary</li>
	<li><input type="checkbox" name="_checklist_guideforushers_3" /> An Usher helps the best man especially during the week of the wedding when he has so much
responsibility, and the bridegroom who may need his services.</li>
	<li><input type="checkbox" name="_checklist_guideforushers_" /> An Usher is required to attend the rehearsal for instructions and exercise of the processional,
ceremony and recessional.</li>
	<li><input type="checkbox" name="_checklist_guideforushers_4" /> The Usher attends the rehearsal dinner and is sometimes asked to give a toast in honor of the

<h3>USHER RESPONSIBILITIES AT THE WEDDING</h3>
<ul class="no-dot">
	<li><input type="checkbox" name="_checklist_guideforushers_5" /> The Usher is required to arrive one hour in advance unless previously notified. He must be
properly dressed with his boutonniere on his left lapel. If gloves are part of the attire, they must
be worn at all times especially for the photographs. (Note: This does not include wearing them
for the reception.)</li>
	<li><input type="checkbox" name="_checklist_guideforushers_6" /> The Usher is required to carry out all the instructions that were previously appointed to him at
the rehearsal.</li>
	<li><input type="checkbox" name="_checklist_guideforushers_7" /> The Usher seats all wedding guests. Seating arrangements should be discussed prior to the wedding
to decide how the Usher should seat guests. It has been the custom in the past to seat friends of
the bride on your left behind the bride's parents, and the bridegroom's friends on the right side.
However, this custom is not followed as strictly as it once was. It is recommended to politely ask a
guest if they are friends of the bride or groom, if the Usher is unaware of their association.</li>
	<li><input type="checkbox" name="_checklist_guideforushers_8" /> The Usher is usually aware of the names of relatives and special friends whom the bride and
groom have reserved space for close to the altar where parents will be seated. Selected Ushers
may be asked to take care of pew ribbons and carpet and to stand at pews to indicate the order
of departure.</li>
