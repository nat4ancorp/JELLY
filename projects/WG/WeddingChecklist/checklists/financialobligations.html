<h2>Financial Obligations</h2>
<p>Tradition . . . a weighty word. In terms of wedding expenses, it once dictated that the bride's
family handled all the nuptial expenses. The changing scheme of society has made it possible for some
ironclad traditions to loosen their grip a bit, and that certainly includes wedding costs. Probably the
most useful approach for you, your groom, and your respective families to consider when you draw
up the wedding budget is to be communicative, realistic, and courteous. If your family is unable to
bear the traditional bridal bill, talk with the groom's parents. They may be willing to assume a portion
of the financial responsibility. There are probably some expenses that you and your groom can pay,
thus taking some pressure off your families.
Following is the traditional division of nuptial expenses. However, there are times when
tradition bows to practicality. The question of who pays for what really boils down to who is most
willing and able.</p>
