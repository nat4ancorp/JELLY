<h2>A Guide for the Maid/Matron of Honor</h2>
<p>An invitation to be in a wedding party is an honor and it carries with it certain responsibilities.
This page will help you better understand your role in the wedding.
The Maid or Matron of Honor is the counterpart of the best man but with less responsibility.
She is the bride's helper and hand-holder.
She should try to relieve the bride of as many tasks as she can before the wedding and
especially on the day itself. Bridesmaids also should offer assistance, particularly as the wedding date
draws closer</p>
