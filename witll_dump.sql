('2012-09-11 18:15:29', 'OMG! I have really been busy with this website. The last time you heard anything from me, the coder behind the most amazing website, was when v.2.9 was the version of this website (The WIFE). Well, the WIFE is getting updating to version 3.0 along with this website. I am glad to announce that there are tons of new features to this beautiful website! Shall we start? Ok! First off, I went out to get a composition (don''t know why) notebook to draw/write my design ideas in, I was able to draw out what I wanted my portfolio to look like, I am going with a Tech/Simple/Colorful Theme, since that speaks to me in many different ways. Next up, I started over-hauling version 2.9 on this site to make room for the new design changes. Then once design set in, I began implementing the necessary code to make the contact form and comment form operational. Let me point out that the contact form is not just a contact-me-only-form. It is a full-blown, operational, PHP ticketing system that checks and balances all ticket traffic that comes in and out of it. Wow! I only wanted to make a contact  form, but instead I got a ticketing system built in to this beautiful website! I guess that is what you get when you mix listening to Dubstep music, sitting in front of a tri-monitor setup computer system, drinking Monster, and coding your portfolio! Anyways, next up in the design implementation of the Launchpad System. I made it more subtle by placing it in a section called the &quot;Toolkit&quot;. The Toolkit is a collection up above the navigation area (where it says Nat4an, About, Blog,...) that can change depending on what you set in the props.php page. I also implemented more database variables (called &quot;Globals&quot;) that you can use to change so of the aspects of this website. Like on Blog, you can set up what to do on post of comment (IE. Subject to Approval), whether or not to accept HTML, and the rest. Nice feature! What else? Oh yeah! The beautiful Search System that knows all. I implemented this up  at the top that can be turned off from the Globals in the database just a while ago. Go ahead and try it! I dare you. You will be amazed! No it is not a &quot;Custom Search&quot; script like most &quot;Lazy Coders/People&quot; do. I do not believe in using scripts, that other people make, to power my website(s). I believe that doing so like that makes you look cheap and if you were to build the script yourself then it makes you look better.<br /><br />Now there are so exceptions to this rule of mine. <u>Number 1</u>: If the script is something like a library (such as jQuery) then I will use it (because it is a tool that I do not want to &quot;re-invent the wheel&quot; by building it from scratch). <u>Number 2</u>: It has to be a script that I have recently built or it has to be a script that I 100% need to use because I do not know how to build it myself (but even then that is still cheap; if you can''t build it - learn to build it, without re-inventing the wheel of course).<br /><br />Back to the updates, I built the Homepage! It will house everything in the whole site (including other launchpads). The individual launchpads will house everything on that launchpad. I will creating a unique jQuery Slider for the homepage(s) to display/showcase new comments, blog posts, content! I made the comment section of the blog entry posts'' really cool by making them look like you peeled a layer back. :) I still need to fix the botr maker. There seems to be a problem with it duplicating each Month Year the amount of N times how many articles are in the month year combo. Still can''t figure it. That''s pure code that determines what month and year to start and end. It depends on what is in the entries database. One of the best parts about my code. Hard to read, simple in POST. :) Oh I added a &quot;Arr&quot; attribute to the Modules (the things on the right called the &quot;sidebar&quot;) that allows you to change it to arrange the modules in any way you want. The idea what I am going to do with this is: when I build the cPanel, when you create a page you can move the modules in to place and it saves the placement to Arr in the database. Don''t know how I''m going to do that but I will take it one step at a time. I also added some spots for Ad rotators. I would like to make a system that rotates the ads and all you have to do is specify what contents to put and where it needs to display. Again, building it on my own to showcase my skillset. Oh, I added some colorful graphics to the About page to go along with the story/content to intrigue the visitors since most of my visiors come to see the About page. I gave the comments form a Moods dropdown so that commentors can specify what mood they are in. That is one feature that I wish most websites had with their comment forms. So if you wish it, so shall it be. Well...I mean why wish others to have something you can build? Hmm...deep. :) Of course the beauty of the Comment System is the ticketing system it has. Yes! My Comment System does have a ticket system. It can be used as a log for you to keep track of the comments you post (since it allows you to search by email) and it is something that allows you to check the status of a comment that is being reviewed. By the way, that setting can be change in the Globals in the database to Approve Immediately, Subject to Approval, or Approve after 24 hours (I haven''t worked in this one yet, but I will find out how I am going to do it). Work page will be worked on later. I plan to make it a titled-layout where it displays projects based on what it is. Idk...I will decide how to do that later. I am burned out. Tired. I am so stoked to see this website get off the ground. I showed it to my friend Sean Casey and he said he liked it, so it looks like I am doing something right. Oh by the way, this website is now SEO with amazing spidey powers!!! I love it. Every page has individual keywords for spiderability! Well...it has been great! Take care and thanks for checking out my updates! Night!', 'UPDATE', 'yes'),
('2012-10-08 19:56:00', '<p>Hello hello hello. A lot has happened since the last time I have done one of these Site Changes Blog. Well, let me start out by saying that I have pushed about 6 major release versions of this site since the last site changes update. So this is going to be probably a big one. Get ready, get set, go!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<ul class="list-circle">\r\n<li>I have created the anime about page with more detail and better-looking CSS; added some JS functionality to the anime FAQs page</li>\r\n<li>Took the Blog Page and made it a Modular System where all you have to do is change a few variables to change up the whole system of how it pulls the information from the database, which led me into making the Anime Watchlist System and Anime A-Z List (which is more like a Blog for Newly-watched Animes). I will need to find out how I am going to make it an A-Z List later</li>\r\n<li>I started building the Anime homepage just like the normal portfolio homepage</li>\r\n<li>There seems to be a Defunct in the Search System for the entire site - it seems to open a different [+] icon when you click on another plus icon only for certain search queries (I don''t know why but it''s weird - seems to be a nofix, wontfix, hopefully I can fix it with the next push)</li>\r\n<li>I added the Pagination System to the other cases (things like Tags, Categories, etc)</li>\r\n<li>Fixed the users Bloggie Page Pagination defunction - even though it no longer uses the pagination system - apparently the userID was not there</li>\r\n<li>I added a &quot;If-none-found-display-this&quot; kind of thing to the Bloggie System pages if there are no authors, categories, entries, directors, studios, etc</li>\r\n<li>cleaned up some of the pages</li>\r\n<li>Fixed the comment send email (the one that sends an email to you when you post or submit a comment) sending mistype - it was saying &quot;Commment&quot;</li>\r\n<li>Fixed the link in the email sent when you post or submit a comment</li>\r\n<li>Updated the Search FilterList with some things that you cannot search for</li>\r\n<li>Changed up the Autoresponder Closing Message by making it dynamically load from the database</li>\r\n<li>Fixed a checkstatus of comment or contact not display date due to not getting the right info</li>\r\n<li>There is a mysql warning message on the search page but that was because there were no search chapters - so technically it''s fixed</li>\r\n<li>Added a modular option to the Bloggie Pages System to where there is a goingtostart date that can be reached (for entries for systems like the Anime A-Z List)</li>\r\n<li>Fixed a Tag Cloud Link Defunction - needed to add correct launchpad (PADMAIN) to the link instead of the launchpad of current</li>\r\n<li>Changed up the timings of the different carousel items in the database on the pages</li>\r\n<li>Added the functionality of sending email notifications to the POCs that get contacted if they have notifications turned on</li>\r\n<li>Added original air dates to the anime Bloggie Systems as a modular option</li>\r\n<li>Created a Modular Lock on the Pages to where you can specify from the database what pages can and cannot be viewed by certain users (audiences) system</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis update has been an exciting one and one built with a ton of progression. I cannot wait to get more stuff done with this site! The more issues I/we tackle, the closer we are to launching to the public and being able to do work for other clients and build something!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Still to come...</h1>\r\n<p>\r\nThere are many things I need to do, but here is a slim list of things I need to get done:\r\n<ul class="list-circle">\r\n<li>Do preliminary work for the cPanel</li>\r\n<li>Build the cPanel functionality</li>\r\n<li>Fix the iPhone and iPad display of the lower right art (as you can see I took it out til it could get fixed)</li>\r\n<li>Search functionality of the The Blog wrong display fix - the one that is the wontfix</li>\r\n<li>Create/Add to the Modular Bloggie System (I would like to add plugins that can be added on to it)</li>\r\n<li>Fix some CSS compatibilty issues in IE, Firefox, Safari, and Opera</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThat seems to be all for this site changes update! Have a good one and enjoy the new changes! Oh I also changed the format of this site changes blog entry. List items!!! Yay! Makes it easier to read. Well have a good one<br /><br />Nathan<br />President and Head Webmaster\r\n</p>', 'UPDATE', 'yes');
