		<h2>I'm sorry but this website is closed due to the new construction of our website. :(</h2>
        <p>The Reason we have closed this website for construction is so that no one can see what we are working on until we do the necessary checks and balances that come with building a website. We also believe that this shows progress and we like progress. :)</p>
