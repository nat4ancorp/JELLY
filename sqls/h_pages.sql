A Better question would be &quot;who is Nat4an?&quot;. Nat4an is a creative, stunny, professional, determined, motivated, challenged, passionate, and focused individual who focuses on becoming the impossible in web design and other passionate fields he enjoys.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back in the day, which was about around 1998, He began his growth as a young, talented, individual in computers. He has always loved computers to the point of sleeping with them (not in an awkward way...:P). He joined a magnet-middle-school when He was in seventh grade. Excelling was what He did the most. He then got into high school where He joined a beautiful program called DATA (Design and Technology Academy). This high school was no ordinary high school. In fact, it housed  some of the most brilliant individuals in Texas. Yes that is right! He is in the beautiful state of Texas. Proud of it! Anyways, You could say that DATA was like Eureka. A society of teenage-dreamers who wanted to shape and build the world to their liking while receiving the best benefits. He then graduated, after 4 years, and went off to discover and build the new world.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<h2 class="pages-maincontent-title">A Word from Nat4an...</h2>\r\n<div class="pages-maincontent-content">\r\n<div class="pages-maincontent-content-inner">\r\n<p>\r\nHi! I am Nat4an, the creator and founder (President and Head Webmaster) of Nat4an.com. I created this website as a place for me to easily share my intellect with the world as well as create communities in which people can share their intellect amongst their peers.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<b>[WARNING]</b> Currently our site is undergoing routine maintenance in the construction of our new server/website. We are changing this whole enviroment on a day-to-day basis. With that being said if you find a bug or glitch, tell us! That is all for this announcement. <b>[/WARNING]</b>\r\n<br /><br />\r\nMy life has been pretty straight forward with many winding twists and turns that any normal life would have. There is nothing normal about my life. Let''s see...born and raised in San Antonio, TX area. Raised in a Christian home and pretty much forced to go to church (not really) all my life. I LOVE to code! I first took on coding when I got my first ever computer at the age of 12. It was an old Pentium \r\n Computer Chipset, you know the really big white one, and I went biserk with it. I took it apart and put it back together more times than I could count on my fingers (at that age). Wait a minute, I remember waaaaayy back, my grandfather built me this big white box (made out of wood...as if boxes are made out of stone) that had all sorts of lights, switches, buttons, a radio, and circuits. Oh man! That was the best toy I had ever received at the time, especially for a young boy. It lasted for a good 6 years. I was what? 4 or 5 when he made it. Man that was the best.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThen of course back to the basics...I got another computer when I was a freshman in high school. An eMachine computer (for free). My neighbor was throwing it out. I learned DOS on it. Oh right, in DATA my first class, as a freshman, was Intro to Design and Computers or something like that (shows how long it has been since I have been in high school...:P). I earned an achievement in there (Best Achievement in Design Technology, 2005). I quickly became a level 12 Flunky in that class. Sophomore year hit and I started to dive into code with OOP languages such as C++. Then junior year hit and I got into more graphical languages like Java. And then as a Senior I worked on more advanced languages like PHP and Perl, building websites, and making some cool stuff (like video with Final Cut Pro, but that''s not code - so I won''t go into it yet).\r\n<br /><br />\r\nCoding has been apart of me all my life and I continue to use it as I grow. I believe that coding is going to be something that I will ultimately use to build the human race 2.0 (ha...I like dreaming).</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<h2 class="pages-maincontent-title">What do I think about the Web?</h2>\r\n<div class="pages-maincontent-content">\r\n<div class="pages-maincontent-content-inner">\r\n<p>\r\nI think that is a good question for every web designer to answer. I think the web can be both an enhancement and a determinant to society. In one way a webpage or something on the web can help someone, such as a web search for "how to feed a gold fish" can help someone learn how to feed their gold fish. Now on the other hand it can be a determinant because you can say something to someone or about someone and not mean it one way and they could take it the other way which could mess up friendships and relationships. People tend to communicate more on the web than they do in real life to the point that they have lost the art of communication.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nIt use to be that you would have asked, back in the late 90s, "do I need a website?". Now you don''t even think twice about not having a website.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nWhat the web really is, to me that is, is it is an old fashion catalog but digitalized in a sense that everything is compressed together to form a backended, connected system, that anyone can use to look through. Hmm...that really flowed well. :)\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<h2 class="pages-maincontent-title">Making decisions</h2>\r\n<div class="pages-maincontent-content">\r\n<div class="pages-maincontent-content-inner">\r\n<p>\r\nIn my experience, I have always taken the tough route (it seems like). I am a strong believer in the fact that people make "split decisions" based on the "one-two-point". What I mean is people seem to (even me) make decisions based on the moment they do something. For example, if I get in trouble at work for something I would make a decision based on that to quit my job. Those kind of "split decisions" can get someone into trouble and might even make their journey a bit tougher. If I would have (hypothetically) quit my job, I would have kicked myself because I wouldn''t have a job and I would be up a creek without a paddle.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nWhen it came down to making this portfolio, I had to think about a few things:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>What best describes me</li>\r\nand\r\n<li>How can I show the world who I am</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBased on those two "questions", I created this site. I believe that the best thing that would describe me is abstract. I like to be creative and make things (whether it is a cool world in Minecraft or making my own CMS with my own named variables and cool functions :P). How can I show the world who I am? Yikes...that is a tough one. I am going to have to think about that.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nBack to the part about the big white box that had all the lights, sounds, buttons, knobs, and switches on it - for a long time I deeply thought about how I should go about making and designing my portfolio, my own little slice of the web. How should I draw it out? What bests describes me, or my life? Is there a single instance of something that would best fit me? Those questions came to mind when building this website. Then it hit me, like a ton of bricks, I thought about how that big white techy box thing that made me so happy (the one I mentioned earlier) and how my whole life has revolved around techy things so much that I knew, I just had to, build and design my website (my portfolio) with buttons, knobs, switches, and all kinds of things. Make it a techy theme, make it fresh, crisp, have perspective, and make best of all - make it me. After all, this isn''t just a web portfolio; it is my life.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe last thing I would like to leave you with is how this portfolio, and me, fit into the grand scheme of things. I believe that one day I will be a renowned leader in modern technology and I would like to grow and shape things around me. This portfolio serves its purpose of being a collection of the works of me and what I do.

The word is the Japanese abbreviated pronunciation of &quot;animation&quot;. The intended meaning of the term sometimes varies depending on the context. While the earliest known Japanese animation dates to 1917, and many original Japanese animations were produced in the ensuing decades, the characteristic anime style developed in the 1960s - notably with the work of Osamu Tezuka - and became known outside Japan in the 1980s.</p>\r\n    \r\n    <p>Anime, like manga, has a large audience in Japan and recognition throughout the world. Distributors can release anime via television broadcasts, directly to video, or theatrically, as well as online.</p>\r\n    <p>Both hand-drawn and computer-animated anime exist. It is used in television series, films, video, video games, commercials, and internet-based releases, and represents most, if not all, genres of fiction. As the market for anime increased in Japan, it also gained popularity in East and Southeast Asia. Anime is currently popular in many different regions around the world.</p>\r\n    \r\n    <p>Anime began at the start of the 20th century, when Japanese filmmakers experimented with the animation techniques also pioneered in France, Germany, the United States, and Russia. The oldest known anime in existence first screened in 1917 - a two-minute clip of a samurai trying to test a new sword on his target, only to suffer defeat. Early pioneers included Shimokawa Oten, Jun''ichi Kouchi, and Seitar Kitayama.</p>\r\n    \r\n    <p>By the 1930s animation became an alternative format of storytelling to the live-action industry in Japan. But it suffered competition from foreign producers and many animators, such as Nobur fuji and Yasuji Murata still worked in cheaper cutout not cel animation, although with masterful results. Other creators, such as Kenz Masaoka and Mitsuyo Seo, nonetheless made great strides in animation technique, especially with increasing help from a government using animation in education and propaganda. The first talkie anime was Chikara to Onna no Yo no Naka, produced by Masaoka in 1933. The first feature length animated film was Momotaro''s Divine Sea Warriors directed by Seo in 1945 with sponsorship by the Imperial Japanese Navy.</p>\r\n    \r\n    <p>The success of The Walt Disney Company''s 1937 feature film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs influenced Japanese animators. In the 1960s, manga artist and animator Osamu Tezuka adapted and simplified many Disney animation-techniques to reduce costs and to limit the number of frames in productions. He intended this as a temporary measure to allow him to produce material on a tight schedule with inexperienced animation-staff.</p>\r\n    \r\n    <p>The 1970s saw a surge of growth in the popularity of manga - many of them later animated. The work of Osamu Tezuka drew particular attention: he has been called a &quot;legend&quot; and the &quot;god of manga&quot;. His work - and that of other pioneers in the field - inspired characteristics and genres that remain fundamental elements of anime today. The giant robot genre (known as &quot;Mecha&quot; outside Japan), for instance, took shape under Tezuka, developed into the Super Robot genre under Go Nagai and others, and was revolutionized at the end of the decade by Yoshiyuki Tomino who developed the Real Robot genre. Robot anime like the Gundam and The Super Dimension Fortress Macross series became instant classics in the 1980s, and the robot genre of anime is still one of the most common in Japan and worldwide today. In the 1980s, anime became more accepted in the mainstream in Japan (although less than manga), and experienced a boom in production. Following a few successful adaptations of anime in overseas markets in the 1980s, anime gained increased acceptance in those markets in the 1990s and even more at the turn of the 21st century.</p>\r\n    \r\n    <h1>My Own Opinion</h1>\r\n    <p>Now that you witness (or read) an account of what anime is from Wikipedia (or at least some of it) comes the time where I share what I think anime is. Anime is definitely what Wikipedia calls &quot;animation&quot; but to me anime is more than that. Anime has always been, is now, and will always be in the lives of many people.</p>\r\n</div>', '', '', '', '$GET_MODULES=mysql_query("SELECT * FROM {$properties->DB_PREFIX}pages_modules WHERE page=''$page'' AND sidebar=''1'' AND launchpad=''$launchpadPN'' ORDER BY arr") or die(''uh oh!
