(1, 'Welcome to the RTA!', 'The Road To Angelo (RTA) Blog is a new blog that I am starting for my journey towards Angelo State University! I decided to start this blog to help me meet people, learn new things, help people with what I do know, and just to be used for something that I can use for accountability for my own selfish desires (yes I do have them...:P)[!--more--]\r\n<h2>My history with blogging</h2>\r\nI use to run a successful blog called The Creation Buzz (TCB) that was a blog for pretty much anything. I had about 100 subscribers to my RSS feed, more than an average of 200 hits a day, and I had content flowing in and out of that blog like it was nobody''s business. It was sure fun and a lot of hard work. I started to run into some complicated (too complicated to tell here) issues after about a year. I was somewhat forced to shut it down (sadly) due to too many spammed comments and other stuff I am not in the mood to talk about right now.\r\n\r\nBlogging has always been a passion of mine. I use to think that I was a Blogger for Passion Not Profit kind of person. Many good things came from blogging. I got to express my ideas. My goals. My thoughts. Cool things. Now I just hope that this blog goes as smooth as my last one. It should, after-all, I am using it to go to college with.\r\n<h2>What I plan to do</h2>\r\nI plan to use this blog to write at least one interesting topic a day that is going on in my life or on the road to angelo. I would like to share what I know in Linux since I am quite the linux junkie. Afterall, I am writing this blog entry from my newly installed Fedora 16 Linux Book. What? You don''t know what a Linux Book is? Well, I''ll tells ya! A Linux Book is a Net Book with Linux installed on it. Yeah. That is pretty straight forward. Anyways, I plan to have a dedicated page to Linux on this here blog. Maybe throw some cool content into it. You know: something I find on StumbledUpon, Twitter, Facebook, etc. Who knows what I will do with this blog.\r\n<h2>What do I think of the Internet?</h2>\r\nI think the Internet, or the Interwebs as I like to call it, is a place where one person could change his or her whole life with just one thing they say or do. I think that the Internet is a place to be someone. I think the Internet is place for businesses to reach thousands (or millions) of people for pennies. I think that the Internet is a place where you can hangout, meet new people, start something, learn new ideas, or just be yourself. Back in the mid 90s, I''m not saying I am old, people use to think "do I need to have a website?". Now a days, you wouldn''t think twice about owning and running a website, even a free wordpress or blogger blog. No I did not just steal that tidbit from <a title="The Amazing World of John Raasch!" href="http://www.Jonraasch.com" target="_blank">Jon Raasch</a>. By the way guys, check out this guys website! He is a freakin genius at web art thingy stuff! Just a shoutout to him. Anywho, I think the web is a place to be creative with your ideas and share them with the world.\r\n<h2>Anyways...</h2>\r\nNow it is time to wish all of you well, wish me well, and just go enjoy life. I will post and update all of you on the progress of my Road to Angelo! Keep comin back here!\r\n\r\nNathan', 1, 1, 'Angelo State University,ASU,Interwebs,John Raasch,my day,The Start,', '2012-03-23 14:22:41', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 2012, '03', '23', '14', '22', '41', 'yes', 'Published', 'yes', 'featured.jpg'),
(2, 'Semester Planning', 'Ah the joys of planning out what you need to take in order to move on with your life. Today I spent most of the day planning my year-long schedule at my current community college so that I can transfer out to Angelo State University.\r\n\r\nI began by finding out what I have taken, what I need to take, and what I could take at my current college. A lot of thinking. I finally narrowed it down to 8 more courses I can/need to take at this current college before going to ASU. I plan on taking 2 courses in the summer I 2012 and 2 courses in summer II 2012 (yeah I know...a lot to worry about plus part time work) then I will go about a full 4 course semester for the Fall of 2012 (yeah...I will do my best).[!--more--]\r\n\r\nThe thing about planning like this: is that you cannot simply just plan on paper, you need to do as well. How do you think I am going to do this? I will plan to study hard, work smart, and have fun (I guess). Well maybe not the have fun part because I can have fun later when I am at Angelo.\r\n\r\nThe rest of my day is going to consist of getting ready for work at 6:00p, I will leave by 5:30p, get there at 5:45p, work smart til 12a, then leave work and come home to relax while watching anime or playing some video game. Oh, you probably didn''t know I watched anime didn''t you? Well, there are a lot of things you need to know about me. You will find out over the course of a year.\r\n\r\nNow I am signing off to go enjoy myself before I go into work. Have fun, be safe, and watch out for baby chipmunks!\r\n\r\nNathan', 1, 1, 'chipmunks,my day,planning,semester planning,work,', '2012-03-24 18:16:44', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 2012, '03', '24', '18', '16', '44', 'yes', 'Published', 'no', ''),
(3, 'Moving from one door to another', 'An the never ending process of going after something that you dream of. I am talking about going after a career that you want to have someday or job that you want to have just for a bit of spending money. I spent my day today waking up at about around 12p (yea I know...I''m a bit of a lazy bum. But you would be too if you stayed up til 3 am watching Oh My Goddess! and Blood+ episodes on Netflix), after getting up I went through my normal routine, and then did some College Algebra (that of which is not going to transfer to ASU...bummer), then worked on an online application for Gold\\''s Gym (I am wanting to drop out of the rat race of call center work and get into a better routine for a young college student who has no bills and no (needed) expenses), and then started writing this here blog entry for all of you (which is less that .00001%).[!--more--]\r\n<h2>What else do I have for you?</h2>\r\nYou want more from me? Hmm...well I did try to redo my iPad 2 by restoring it only to find out that when I try to sign in to Apple iTunes it keeps coming back with some weird user names and not letting me sign in. Weird. I will try it later.\r\n\r\nI also would like to play a bit of Maplestory for my own sick twisted mind. I also need to work on the overall appearance of this blog. That is pretty much it.\r\n<h2>The thing about moving to another door</h2>\r\nThere is something strange when moving from one position at a company to another less paid but better working condition position. It is a transition to a new thing. We all love new things. When it comes down to leaving this one $11 an hour job to going with schooling and maybe even a little $9 an hour part time job, I would miss the pay but seeing as though it is not needed in my life at this point I won''t miss it too much.\r\n\r\nWhen moving from one job to another you have to wonder about the people you use to work with, how are they going to do without you, did you leave such an impact on them that they will miss you?, how can you keep in touch with them?, and other questions like those stated above.\r\n\r\nI do like the position I am at but I honestly could do without work and focus on school at this point. School is more important and if I needed to work and make some money I could always go look for some part time work place thing.\r\n\r\nSo as of this blog I am saying that I will be leaving in about 9 weeks. Not to mention I have Tier 2 Training starting April 1st which means that I will have at least some Tier 2 experience that I can put on my resume for future prospect.\r\n\r\nNow I am going to go do some financial stuffs, play some maple, get ready for work, and hope for a good night! Stay beautiful everyone (all .00001% of you) and don''t do anything I wouldn''t do; but if you do then don''t name it after me. :)\r\n\r\nNathan', 1, 1, 'another door,career path,education importance,golds gym,moving on,school,tier 2,', '2012-03-25 04:29:22', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 2012, '03', '25', '04', '29', '22', 'yes', 'Published', 'no', ''),

With the new Fedora 16 just being released, it (being Google Chrome) is now available to be used as a web browser. I know that this is blowing up all over the place but I would just like to point out some tricks that helped me to install Google Chrome on my Fedora 16 LinuxBook.[!--more--]\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<strong>To learn how to do this correctly, follow the step by step instructions below.</strong>\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<em>* = you will need to be root (or type in the root password) to use</em>\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<strong>Step 1:</strong> First you start out by opening up the Terminal on your Fedora 16 (assuming that you have already fired up Fedora 16)\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<strong>Step 2:</strong> Next enter the follow into the Terminal window:\r\n<br />\r\n<code>wget https://dl-ssl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub</code>\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe above will use:\r\n<br />\r\n<code>wget</code>\r\n<br /><br />\r\nto install Google''s Signing Key for use in installing and running Google Chrome. I''m not quite sure what it does but I do believe to my knowledge it allows Chrome to run on Fedora.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<strong>*Important:</strong>\r\n<br />\r\nIf you get:\r\n<br />\r\n<code>bash: wget: command not found</code>\r\n<br /><br />\r\nwhen you try to run the above line, run this in the Terminal to download wget\r\n<br />\r\n<code>sudo yum install wget</code>\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThis will install:\r\n<br />\r\n<code>wget</code>\r\n<br />\r\nso that you can then run the command from step 2.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<strong>*Step 3:</strong> Next run this line in the Terminal:\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<code>sudo rpm --import linux_signing_key.pub</code>\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThis will install the signing key to your Fedora 16 installation\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<strong>*Step 4:</strong> Now we need to add the repository.

Note: you should never be root unless you know what you are doing.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<strong>Step C:</strong> Next go into your <em>/etc/yum.repos.d/</em> directory and create a new file called <em>google.repo.</em>\r\n\r\nOnce you do that paste the information below, according to your Architecture, into the <em>google.repo</em> file and save it.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<strong>For 32-bit</strong>\r\n<br />\r\n[google-chrome]\r\n<br />\r\nname=google-chrome - 32-bit\r\n<br />\r\nbaseurl=http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/rpm/stable/i386\r\n<br />\r\nenabled=1\r\n<br />\r\ngpgcheck=1\r\n<br />\r\ngpgkey=https://dl-ssl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<strong>For 64-bit</strong>\r\n<br />\r\n[google-chrome]\r\n<br />\r\nname=google-chrome - 64-bit\r\n<br />\r\nbaseurl=http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/rpm/stable/x86_64\r\n<br />\r\nenabled=1\r\n<br />\r\ngpgcheck=1\r\n<br />\r\ngpgkey=https://dl-ssl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<strong>*Step 5:</strong> Now we need to install the actual browser so type this into the Terminal:\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<strong>To install the Stable version</strong>\r\n<br />\r\n<code>sudo yum install google-chrome-stable</code>\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<strong>To install the Beta version</strong>\r\n<br />\r\n<code>sudo yum install google-chrome-beta</code>\r\n<br /><br />\r\nYou can also install the unstable version if you would like to, personally I would not but if you want to test and debug it then be my guest.\r\n<br />\r\n<code>sudo yum install google-chrome-unstable</code>\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAnd there you have it!

This world is such an <a title="This Ugly Yet Beautiful World (Anime)" href="http://www.nat4an.com/af/a-z-list/this-ugly-yet-beautiful-world" target="_blank">Ugly Yet Beautiful World</a> that we live and breath in.\r\n\r\nWhy do I come out and say these kinds of things on the blog? Because I am just a believer of certain things? Because I care? Because I love the world as much as it should be love? Why do I feel this way?\r\n<h2 style="text-align: center;">All are good questions that will one day be answered.</h2>[!--more--]\r\nNow that I think about it, people go throughout this fragile life just as it were they were the queen of some distant planet yet what it all comes down to, in the end, it doesn''t really matter.

It is a Lenovo 3000 N200 (Intel Pentium(R) Dual CPU T2390 @ 1.86GHz x 2) with about a GB of memory. Yeah! The memory sucks atm but I am looking into improving this baby''s performance. Hopefully I can get it to run some pretty freakin'' badass games. I am also testing the battery life on this bad boy just to see if it is good enough to take places. The only downside of this computer is I don''t think it supports two-finger scrolling (or horizontal scrolling) but I will make it work. :P[!--more--]\r\n\r\nAlong with installing Fedora 16 on my newly-acquired laptop, is to do all the tweaking one can do on a decent laptop with Fedora. I had to install Flash Plugin, Chrome, and Eclipse (not to mention Java).\r\n\r\nThen I keep on having the keys get stuck so I just take the key off and use some compressed air to clean out the junk out from them. Talk about a major overhaul on this laptop. But it is all worth it.\r\n\r\n<strong>UPDATE</strong>: I just found out that the battery life is only 3 minutes even though I charged it up all freakin'' night. So you know what that means right? Correct! I gotta go to the Interwebs Computer Store (eBay) to buy a battery for this soon-to-be beast. It looks like batteries like that for this particular model are ranging from $30 to $40. Meh...I have a job. :)\r\n\r\nSo today went well for me. Training (T2) as usual. Not anything new.

I took the liberty to move my free wordpress-hosted crapping, underdeveloped blog to a more natural, free, open, and spacious self-hosted blog on my new Hosting Account with HostGator.\r\n\r\nYeah, I am not going to lie, having a website back in my control has been the best thing that has happened to me this week.  There is just something about hosting your own wordpress blog, or even hosting a self-built website, on your own server. You have more room to customize and modify your page/blog/website; You have the free reign of actually having a domain name instead of a sub-domain off another company; and it is just bada5s to own a website because of the sole reason that now a-days you would not even thing twice about whether or not you should have a website.[!--more--]\r\n\r\nAnyways, lots of new things happened to me since the last time I blog.  First off, I installed  Windows 7 Ultimate Edition (twice over) because I was running into some sort of issue that was causing a conflict with my systems (Windows 7 Ultimate Edition and Fedora 16). That issue has been resolved. Another issue, regarding computer, is that I managed to get my computer''s BIOS properly set on the timing (with memory) and overclocking (so now I am running 4 cores of 2.67 GHz as apposed to 4 cores of 2.6 GHz; Yay! A whopping .07 GHz more!!! Hey! Don''t you been laughing, at least it''s more!). Oh yeah...the timing on my memory chipset thingy. I managed to get two slightly identical chipsets 2 pairs of memory to work without crashing my computer. Yay! Of course the real test will come whenever I get the chance to play a highly intense game.\r\n\r\nTuesday (4/24/2012) went really really well. Tuesday was business-casual day at work. I also attended some Yoga classes at school to make up some absences  in my physical conditioning class. And that was pretty much it.\r\n\r\nYesterday (4/25/2012) was a decent day. Had a test in College Algebra that I felt okay on for the most part but we will find out how I did on this next monday. I got back into playing League of Legends (LoL) with Yul (my friend...yes I do have them :P), and then I came home to have a sit down dinner with the folks.\r\n\r\nToday (4/26/2012) got my Physical Conditioning paper done, turned it in, and bam! Then went to another Yoga class to make up another absence (I have been a naughty boy :P), then went to go play 9 holes of bogey golf. Well, it was bogey til I actually sunk a birdie on the 9th hole. I went crazy and from there on my day became better. Now I am writing this waiting to go to guitar practice and then Two42.\r\n\r\nThere is something I have to say about today:\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<h2>You can do anything you set your mind to</h2>\r\n</blockquote>\r\nA wise man once told me that you can do anything you set your mind to in anything subject, sport, game, or anything. I took this to heart and thought about it. Why do I give up sometimes when I am just right around the corner to victory? Just like today on the golf course. I was having a terrible day. Hitting bogey, double-bogey, triple-bogey, and the rest. I was about to quit before the last two holes. But instead I pressed on and set my mind to what I needed to do. The last hold came and there I was. On the tee box, I hit what I had thought was decent drive which turned 0ut to be a great driver. Right in the fairway. Then thought about what to hit on my second shot. I chose 8 over 7 since it would not put me over the green. I hit the ball. It flew straight and then I came up to hit the third shot thinking that I was over when out of no where I see the ball 6 inches from the hole. I was ecstatic. Tapped it in for birdie and went home.\r\n\r\nThen I thought: I guess I can do anything I set my mind to. Oh by the way, that wise person who told me about setting your mind to anything, <strong>that was my father</strong>. So thanks for being there for me dad!\r\n\r\nAnyways, now we are done. Hope you have a good one and enjoyed this post! Now I am off to guitar, then Two42.

If you have accidentally updated to the iOS 5.1.1 firmware however, you will be glad to know that you can indeed Jailbreak iOS 5.1.1 tethered on your iPhone 4 or iPhone 3GS using the latest version ofRedSn0w. Thus, in this how to guide you will learn how to Jailbreak your iPhone 4 or iPhone 3GS tethered on iOS 5.1.1 using the Windows version of RedSn0w 0.9.12b8b.[!--more--]\r\n<h2>Jailbreak iPhone 4, 3GS iOS 5.1.1 Windows</h2>\r\n\r\n<strong>Step 1)</strong> The first thing you will need to do is download the latest version of RedSn0w, which at the time of writing this how to guide is <strong>RedSn0w 0.9.10b8b</strong>. You can download RedSn0w 0.9.12b8b from the direct link below:\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<a href="(baseurl)files/redsn0w_win_0.9.12b2.zip" target="_blank">Download RedSn0w 0.9.12b8b (Windows)</a>\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<strong>Step 2)</strong> Once you have downloaded RedSn0w you will need to extract it by right clicking on the <em>redsn0w_win_0.9.10b8b.zip</em> and click the extract to folder option.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nWhen RedSn0w has been extracted find the <em>redsn0w.exe</em> file, right click on it and click the <em>Run as administrator</em> option (if applicable).\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<strong>Step 3)</strong> With RedSn0w running you will need to click the <strong>Jailbreak button</strong>.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<strong>Step 4)</strong> After clicking the Jailbreak button you will come to a screen where you will need to put your iPhone into DFU mode.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nRead through and follow the instructions presented to you which is to plug in and power off your iPhone and then click the <strong>next button</strong> when you are ready to begin the DFU mode process.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<strong>Step 5)</strong> When you click the next button you will need to follow the instructions presented to you in real-time to put your iPhone into DFU mode.\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Hold down Power (corner) button for 5 seconds.</li>\r\n	<li>Without releasing the Power button, also hold down the Home (bottom center) button along with the Power button for 10 seconds.</li>\r\n	<li>Without releasing the home button, stop holding down the power button for up to 15 seconds.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<strong>Step 6)</strong> After you successfully enter DFU mode RedSn0w 0.9.10b8b will begin preparing your iPhone for the Jailbreak.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<strong>Step 7)</strong> Once RedSn0w has finished preparing your iPhone for the Jailbreak you will be asked you to specify options to go along with your Jailbreak. The only option that you actually need to make sure is checked is the Install Cydia option. Once you have ensured this option is checked, and any other options you may want, click the Next button.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<strong>Step 8)</strong> After you have specified your Jailbreak options you can click the <strong>next button</strong> andRedSn0w 0.9.10b8b will begin jailbreaking your iPhone. DO NOT interrupt or use the computer during this time. When your iPhone is finished being jailbroken it will boot up with the Apple logo and not go any further. This is because you have a tethered Jailbreak and you will need to put your iPhone back in DFU mode and use RedSn0w 0.9.10b8b to boot it back into a functional and Jailbroken state.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<strong>Step 9)</strong> As explained previously when you Jailbreak your iPhone tethered you will need to plug it into your computer every time your iPhone loses power to regain all functionality. Thus, to reboot your iPhone into a functional and Jailbroken state you will need to launch RedSn0w again, click the Extras Button > then click the Just boot button and you will simply need to put your iPhone into DFU mode again.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nCongrats! You should now have a Jailbroken iPhone 4 or iPhone 3GS running the iOS 5.1.1 firmware.', 1, 2, 'break phone,hack,howto,iphone,iphone 4,jailbreak,redsn0w,tutorials,', '2012-05-09 10:42:42', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 2012, '05', '09', '10', '42', '42', 'yes', 'Published', 'yes', 'featured.jpg'),

I would like to point out some really beauty aspects and benefits to going out of town this weekend.\r\n\r\n1. It allowed my to get away from it all and realize my true potential\r\n\r\n2.

Sometimes reconnecting with your inner-self is the best thing you could ever do\r\n\r\n<h1>Purging my room</h1>\r\nMy whole family decided that it was finally time to change out the nasty carpet that lined the upstairs rooms. We got brand spanking new carpet that feels like your walking on a cloud when you...well walk on it.\r\n\r\nI love the feeling because it made me and my sister both take all the crap in our rooms and closet and purge it until very little was left.\r\n\r\nWhat I am especially doing is I am inventorying my whole entire room. Starting from my computer and working my way to the right side of the room, where currently there is a pile of stuff sitting there.\r\n\r\nI never knew how much stuff I had.\r\n<h1>Back to Full Time Work</h1>\r\nI plan to go back to a full time schedule at work because I now know what kind of work I am doing and I want to occupy my time with as much stuff as I can do. Face it, if you''re going to do something for eight hours a day why not make some cash on the side? Especially at $11 an freaking hour!\r\n\r\nThe other side of a new full time schedule is a different shift. Yes I will going to a 10 am to 6:45 pm shift with Thursday and Friday off.

(22, 'A day that we all have not forgotten...', 'It seems like forever ago when that strange thing happened to us. Some of us barely remember; Some of us don''t even know; and some of us chose to forget. Hi, I am Nat4an and I am here to talk about today being 9/11/12.[!--more--]\r\n\r\n<h2>The Story</h2>\r\n<p>It was a bright, beautiful day in the world of USA. New York to be exact. Many people were in a different mindset that day until the worst attack in US History happened. The World Trade Center was hit and now today there lies a memorial for the lost souls of that attack. For many people this came at a shock. A shock that rocked the everyday lives of the US Inhabitants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We now are heading into the 11th anniversary of 9/11 (what we called it at the time) and I for one am not going to give the full story here since I am not a journalist. To read the full story, I am sure you can google it. :) So what were you doing that day? I was a young, elementary student (kid) in 5th or 4th grade. I did not realize at the time what was happening because I was too young. But now that I have had the chance to grow up in a post-9/11 age, I realize something - there are many countries who hate how we have the freedom to do whatever we desire. Many countries would love to have that freedom and we as Americans take it for granted.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How does that affect us now?</h2>\r\n<p>Right now we have a very important election coming up that could mean to some people the difference between life and death. We got, out of all the candidates, one candidate and current president attempting to decolonize America by bringing us into a socialistic government. IE. Putting the government in charge of everything which means limiting the freedom we have. The same freedom that rings and other countries wish they had. He tells us in a book entitled &quot;Dreams from My Father\r\n&quot; some ideas that come from his father about how America is so BIG, bad, and ugly and that things need to happen in order to change it. The change he was talking about in 2008 when he was elected.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Why am I writing about this?</h2>\r\n<p>I feel like I should write about this because this kind of story is considered memorable and old news but I for one want to keep it alive by doing what I can to honor my country and let those who don''t know or have forgotten the story that shook us to the core. If it weren''t for 9/11, we would be totally different today. Also, I like it that the date today is 9/11/12. A consecutively-sequenced date and I like consecutively-sequenced dates. In fact, I sleep with consecutively-sequenced dates. Okay, that is way too much information. Back on topic, I would also like to tell you to wake up. Yes, I already know you are awake but I mean look what the world is turning into and look how the government is trying to change us, change the very foundation our fore-fathers planted, change that WE REALLY DON''T NEED.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Closing remarks</h2>\r\nThank you for taking the time to read my blog post on 9/11/12 out of all the one-hundred-million other posts out there on the interwebs. I know that this entry may not get that many views, but this is more for a library collection that I am building - one blog at a time. I mean just look at the progress I made so far. If you don''t know where to look, you can start by checking out the &quot;Search Nat4an.com...&quot;. Go ahead and type in anything (any topic, word, phrase, etc) into it and see what I am talking about. That is the work of a true coding genius. One who takes the time, out of his busy developing schedule, to create a custom search for his entire web portfolio, after many painful hours of slaving away at a hot keyboard instead of going out and searching for a pre-built Custom Search  Engine and slapping it on the site and calling it a day - a process that most developers use in order to take the easy road, but this comes at a cost and that is the cost of showcasing your work to a potential employer or client. Of course, this blog entry is not quite the place to discuss this topic so I will continue closing this entry but I just wanted to point out what I had done, in the most reserved way, and let it serve as a prime example for this entire blog entry. Back to what I was concluding, that this is what America is suppose to be like. A place that is not lazy and does work to create jobs, develop things instead of taking from other places, and staying the way it has always been since the days of our ancestors. I leave you with this: what were you doing on 9/11 and how did it affect you? Take care and Nat4an signing off.

(24, 'Why you should use Google Chrome to design your website', '<p>Are you a web developer/designer? Do you need a testing platform to develop all your many web applications? Have you yourself ever wondered "What web browser should I use to design in?"? Have you ever stumbled across multiple websites that tell you to use this browser or that browser? If you answered yes to one or more of the following questions, then this article is for you!</p>[!--more--]\r\n\r\n<h1>The Basis of Web Design</h1>\r\n<p>Web Design is the design, rendering, building, creating, and developing model of the whole entire World Wide Web. Without design there is no creativity. Without creativity we all just look at blank, blan, ordinary, websites that will get us no where and do nothing for us. Through Web Design we can become the extraordinary and rise above competition to provide beautiful, elegantly-designed, multiplexes of gates to other realms and show prospective clients that we know what we are doing and we mean business.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nWeb Design requires a strong creative gene and a good eye for color. It is something that is shaping up to be something that is the backbone of the internet if it hasn''t already become that. Creativity makes the web more colorful and personal to the visitor.\r\n</p>\r\n<h1>My Approach</h1>\r\n<p>When it comes down to designing and building web applications and websites I like to use the simple 3-step process. First I write out pseudo-code of the webpage/website I am trying to make. Pseudo-code is a form of code that is when you write in basic english "this is going to do that, when you click this" sort of format. An alternative to pseudo-code is writing your website/webpage in plain basic HTML. This helps the designer to see their website before actually putting the functionality into it. Next step is to take the static code and make it dynamic by using PHP. This makes your sites more modular and easier to manage. Lastly, you will want to check <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization " target="_blank">Search Engine Optimization</a> (SEO) and Functionality of your code as well as check to see if your CSS (considering you put CSS in your page) is compatible across multiple web browsers (Firefox, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer (5, 6, 7, 8, and 9), Safari, Opera, and occasionally Netscape/Konqueror). And for the cases with different compatibility issues, you can create <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/css/condcom.html" target="_blank">conditional CSS</a> (or <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-css3-conditional-20120911/ " target="_blank">here</a> or <a href="http://www.webmonkey.com/2010/02/browser-specific_css_hacks/ " target="_blank">here</a>) in your HTML files (because CSS does not let you put this conditional CSS in them directly or you can use a <a href="http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/browser-specific-hacks/ " target="_blank">few hacks to make it easier</a> but I highly recommend not doing because it could be considered as "cutting corners". Only use hacks if you have exhausted every attempt to use conditional CSS and you are out of options).  Using Conditional CSS will direct the web browser to display the correct CSS style and hopefully put an end to this Web Designer''s nightmare.</p>\r\n<h1>Why do different browsers display pages different?</h1>\r\n<p>A browser is a program developed to display the contents of a web server in the form of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG" target="_blank">WYSIWYG</a> method. So "Why do different browsers display pages differently?". That seems to the be the question that plagues the internet most of the time. A web browser displays code after being interpreted or rendered. It''s in that process of rendering or interpreting that the browser interprets the page in a unique way according to the browser''s standards. It also depends on the visitors Operating System (OS) and the visitor''s display resolution. <a href="http://kb.siteground.com/ " target="_blank">SiteGround KB</a> writes in a similar article <blockquote>"Web browsers do not render pages pixel by pixel. They read the entire code and produce an output depending on your code. There are, however, differences in the code interpretation. Therefore you should check the way your website looks on different browsers and operating systems."</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>This is definitely true in almost all cases. I cannot tell you how much trouble I have saved myself just by looking at my websites in multiple browsers. Especially when you are working on a prospective client''s website, you want to check the website''s compatibility before handing the keys over to them and risking the chance of them finding out you didn''t completely check their site for compatibility issues.</p>\r\n<h1>How can I overcome Cross-Compatible Web Design?</h1>\r\n<p>You can do what we were talking about above and that is by checking the website in multiple browsers. Oh I know, I found this tool for you that checks your website and displays it in multiple browsers. Here it is:\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<a href="http://www.browsershots.org" target="_blank">Browser Shots</a>\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAlthough overcoming this overwhelming issue isn''t solved with a simple yet complex website the checks your website in multiple browsers. Overcoming this obstacle starts with the way you write your code since a web browser interprets your code and produces an output based on what it reads. So naturally, purely changing your Web Design code-making skills up to match demands of popular web browsers would be the first step in overcoming this crisis that plagues most, if not all, web designers.\r\n</p>\r\n<h1>Why Google Chrome?</h1>\r\n<p>Finally, after exploring the ins and outs of Web Design can we now answer the sole question that this article is in-directly/directly talking about. Google Chrome comes equipped with a beautiful, functional, better Inspect Element module that allows you to control more aspects of your sites easily. Even though a majority of web browsers have this, Google Chrome actually does this more elegantly and more flawlessly as well. Google Chrome''s engine is designed to display websites the correct way by rendering them in a way unlike what most web browsers do. Chrome also has a minimalistic interface that doesn''t take up to much memory which would cause the page to load differently (faster). Other aspects of Google Chrome is the way most code looks, how the browser itself is much faster, there is a Large library of extensions and add-ons,  and the whole fact that you can go Incognito when browsing a page, which means for us web designers that no one can see what we are surfing.<br /><br />Here is a randomly-selected video on youtube, that I believe gets enough views to show you, that explains a bit more in detail (with video) the ends and outs of Google Chrome:\r\n[youtube id=1]TXC-pAk_tHE[/youtube]\r\n</p>\r\n<h1>Closing Remarks</h1>\r\n<p>In the end, does it really matter if I have a website that displays the same in all web browsers? Absolutely! Because of the way that a browser interprets your code and outputs based on that you must be one step ahead of the browser by tweaking your code and knowing how it displays so that you can make sure your websites load faster, better, and look nicer. Google Chrome makes browsing a dream and it just keeps getting better and better. I use Google Chrome myself to design (at least start out) all my websites and then move into looking at my design in other web browsers. In a way you could say that Google Chrome is my favorite web browser and I will continue to use it. So what are you waiting for? Go ahead and download a copy of <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/ " target="_blank">Google Chrome</a> for FREE and see how much better it is when you design websites. Heck even if your surfing the web it is much better.

Such updates consisted of building this surely amazing and totally built-by-me cPanel, giving my site a complete make over, and just doing the normal, and totally not boring thing, of developing.</p>\r\n[!--more--]\r\n<h2>Life is tough</h2>\r\n<p>I know what you guys are thinking? "Why are you making your own site cPanel CMS when you could just use Wordpress?" Okay maybe that was too specific of a question, but the point is: I have been building me own CMS because it allows me to develop something and set goals for myself; despite all the headaches I have had just trying to get a damn $ variable to work with a certain insert_function_here(). This whole stuff fascinates me as a developer. From building something that is for the sole purpose of converting strings such as <b>open parenthesis</b> baseurl <b>closed parenthesis</b> (NOTE: I had to write it that way since If I chose to write it the correct way it will convert it like this\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<code>(baseurl)</code>\r\n<br /><br />\r\nSee that just gave us the base url of this site.) to completely getting a posting/editing/tweaking/building/managing cPanel system to fully work without having to access a single database. It''s tough. But oh so worth it. Just writing this content is tricky enough - there are certain things you must do in order to ensure posting of content to a database comes out sanitized and un-obstructive in the event some despicable hacker/leecher/breaker/terrorist comes along and injects your code with something malicious. Oh yeah, as a developer one must think like a hacker in order to prevent hacking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That being said, no one person is safe from malicious activity done to them. One must take all necessary provisions to "counter-hack and protect". For me, I am more of a 50/50 person when it comes to hacking. I wouldn''t be caught dead hacking a bank but I will hack my iPhone 4S iOS 6.0 to allow me to tweak it in a way that allows certain fun things to go on inside my phone. Like a party! Sorry, squirrel-moment. But if it''s one thing I have learned from developing is that you have to be one step ahead of the game.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How''s life you say?</h2>\r\n<p>Not bad, just the normal usual development stuff I do everyday. I like to develop. In case you haven''t already figured that much out. If you haven''t heard, I now work at a fine institution called The Wedding Guide, once of the biggest Wedding companies in Austin and San Antonio, as a web assistant helping maintain web profiles, doing odd web work, and learning more commercial web stuff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am freakin amaZing! Why? Because I built future functionality into the posts/pages changer for sorts (sort by date, title, etc) and I am loving how I did that. Yeah, still coding here, making things happen! And look, I found a ghost variable. What is a ghost variable? I think I made it up. It is when a variable appears and you have no idea where it is coming from. Seriously, I checked the code and nothing resembles that. Weird.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>In the end...</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I think that the best part about being able to say that I made my own framework for my website is that I know how much effort goes into something like this. I will keep working on this site and it will soon become something amazing.

I was 7 when I first got a computer and was excited, really anxious, to dive right into learning the entire workings of it. I was a young William, at least what they called me at the time, who quickly learned the art of successful obstructive and elicit computer hacking.[!--more--]The first thing I would do upon powering up that ultra-sleek machine was find and launch the Terminal-based command line where I could do anything from echoing anything I typed into it to creating a small, obtrusive program to record keystrokes of fellow keyboarders who just so happened to use the library''s computer system for logging into their banks.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>At the age of 9, slightly 2 years after, my friends at school started calling me â€œWillâ€ because my name was apparently to long for them to spell. I would always be seen on my laptop during breaks and lunchtimes. So much to the point that they started joking around with me and saying that I was â€œin the codeâ€ and calling me childish nicknames. Little did they know, I had the knowledge to do anything. After an intense childhood of hacking, a group know as The Anti-Hacker Elite Group (AHEG) gave me a choice, actually two, when they caught me apparently hacking into the United Nations Bank. The story to that is: one day I was at a coffee bar with my laptop scanning for people''s computers connected to the network when all of a sudden this one connection popped up with the answer to an age old question I had been looking for. For the longest time I was trying to figure out how I could ascertain monetary value from my computer skills. Long-story-short, I found the codes to the bank vault; which was not your contemporary vault but one that was a series of algorithmic pass codes on a 128-bit encryption server. I used my knowledge and tools to acquire about $3.5 million worth of goods. I was set, that is until a series of private detectives found me out. The choices they gave me were: 1. work for them - living a life under constant watch with no privacy or 2. I would be locked away in prison for the rest of my life for the millions, if not billions, of dollars I legitimately, hacked out of people bank accounts. Knowing that I wouldn''t see the end of either one of these choices or they wouldn''t favor me; I chose to make a third option: drop off the face of the planet and live underground. This was done by...wait why would I tell you guys. Ha.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>I managed to escape from the AHEG and today it is living proof that I succeeded. The AHEG continued trying to track me down but failed miserably. Now if you excuse me, since you know my story, I am late for my lunch with the queen of England that I am flying to in my privately, anonymously-owned jet that I acquired somehow with funds from an unknown source. The story to that will remain a mystery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This short story has been written by Nat4an himself apart of one of his classes.

(29, 'A Day of Nat4an 2 or maybe it is just Nat4an', '<h1>NAT4AN.COM 2.0</h1>\r\n<p>Well, it''s not quite 2-point-O per say, but it is changing rapidly with all the new changes that are being made to it every single day. I would like to start this interesting entry of the blog (or shall I call it: In The Beginning (ITB) blog) due to the astonishing fact that I am now renaming it from it''s predeceasing form - <a href="(baseurl)(homelp)/blog/permalink/2012/03/23/Welcome-to-the-RTA@">The RTA Blog</a>. I originally started calling it The RTA Blog because I was heading out on a, what feels like now, endless road to San Angelo State University. The name stuck around for a while but I then ran into some minor setbacks and well, decided that it wasn''t proper to call it that. So I am now thinking to call it The ITB Blog because of a reason only I know. What? You want to know why? It''s nothing special. Just some idea I like. Nah...who am I kidding? You don''t want to hear why I called it that.</p>\r\n[!--more--]\r\n\r\n<h1>The Truth Revealed</h1>\r\n<p>So you decided to keep reading and you really want to know why I called it In The Beginning? Well...for you and since you are a good reader of "Cult of Nat4an" (ha ha...nah jk) I guess, I mean, I will tell ya. I named this blog In The Beginning because that resembles a very special time in this world. A time of new beginnings, fresh starts, and creations. Um...I''m talking about the creation of this world, no universe when God created the Heavens and the Earth. I am very fascinated by Creationism and what God has done. Seriously, just take a look outside at a sunset and tell me you cannot see the mighty work of God in it. Go on. Do it now!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So I decided to name this blog ITB because of the creation of something cool, new, fun, exciting, never-ending, beautiful, wonderful, and simply awestruck amazing. I recently just had a vision, no an apprehension, about what I was to do with my life, or what God called me to do. I believe I am to reach out into the darkness towards those who are lost, sick, tired, and burned out and help them come to know and understand that the party is not a party just because you get wasted, high, drunk, or whatever you kids call it these days. The party doesn''t have to be with the people who are satanical or dis-believers. The party is not in hell but in heaven and that heaven is not just a place of boringness just because there is no drinking and getting drunk. So many people in this lost world believe that hell is where the party is and "satan is my best friend" and all kinds of confusion of the sorts. It sickens me to see how this world is literally a "sick and twisted affair". I just want to be a light.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Now time for the day</h1>\r\n<p>Well, today was good and normal. Work is going smooth. Doing my thing on a project that is essentially going to be a place where people can vote on videos that are uploaded and that kinds of sorts. It''s coming along. Wish there was more money in the bank. Got about $18 in there after tossing money towards an alaskan mission trip in the summer (which I found out may be more since the plane tickets to alaska are almost going to be $1100 to $1400) which would be an amazing trip if Lord willing and He wants me to go. Um...well...what else? Worked on this site for a while. Fixing stuff. Watched some Walking Dead to which I am now caught up on. Going to go watch some more Duck Dynasty. And that is about it. Great day today! I liked it. If it is anything you should take away from this blog post, it is that - look around you and try to see your world the way it is; it might surprise you and if you happen to see a young, nice-looking, rockstar around by the name of nat4an please help him out. :) Thanks for reading and enjoy the rest of your day!</p>\r\n', 1, 1, 'nat4an,new,my day,day,general,alaska,mission trip,trip,creation,rockstar,tickets,plane,sick and twisted affair,ITB,In The Beginning,Walking Dead,Cult of Nat4an,cult,roadtoangelo,rta,simplicity,', '2013-02-21 20:56:44', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 2013, '02', '21', '20', '56', '44', 'yes', 'Published', 'yes', 'featured.jpg'),

If not, then forget I said that. :) But since you are such a good saver of the monies, you must already know exactly what you are going to do with your tax refund. Yes, that is right! Tax Season is, or was, among us. Since most of you are so anxious to spend your tax refund on useless junk, why not take into this consideration: <strong>save it</strong>. You never know what might happen and you could always use a stack of cash sitting in your bank account, in your atomic-preventive safe, or in between your worn out mattress. Why? Because of the fact that you could use that money somewhere more important such as pay last month''s rent or help pay for school tuition. Basically, no matter what you decide to do with your refund just make sure it is not going to something useless and wasteful. A good idea would be to put it into a money mutual or at least savings account to draw some interest. Me? I am going to keep my in my bank account just to save it for when I have to pay that mountainous pile of debt. Ha...I kid. But seriously, that would be a great idea if I had debt. For now I will use it for school.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>And then there was the News for today</h1>\r\n<p>So today was just a normal day, got up from an exciting night of playing Halo 4 and getting kill joys all day, and just did my normal thing.

An issue that comes up with some jailbreakers and a few non-jailbreakers. An issue of most importance to our phones. An issue that is easy to fix. The issue at hand is when your iPhone displays no 3G, 4G, or LTE that which causes your iPhone to have no data service.[!--more--]\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Story, cause everyone likes a good story...</h2>\r\n<p>One day I was minding my own business out in a less-than-urban part of town where I tend to drop a bit in and out but not to much to cause me to notice, when all of sudden my iPhone displays an "E". I thought to myself that this wasn''t much to worry about since it is just trying to search for a better signal. Once I get back into town, my iPhone usually turns back to 4G - it didn''t. This didn''t bother me too much since it may have taken a bit longer for the signal juice to start kicking in. The next day, at work while I was mucking about with web stuff, I look down at my iPhone to see that it still said "E". I quickly started to become increasingly frustrated at this issue because of the fact that I pay for 4G service and am only getting slow less-than-good quality service. Plus I was in an extremely urban part of town. After doing a bit of research, I quickly found out that the "E" meant "EDGE".</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What is EDGE?</h2>\r\n<p>EDGE, which stands for Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution, is a faster version of GSM yet not as fast as LTE or 4G. EDGE is a high-speed 3G technology that was built upon the GSM standard. EDGE networks are designed to deliver multimedia applications such as streaming television, audio and video to mobile phones at speeds up to 384 Kbps. Such speeds still pale in comparison, though, to standard DSL and high-speed cable access today.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>That''s all well, good, and fine...but how does that affect me?</h2>\r\n<p>Well you eager beaver, it is important that I explained what EDGE was to help you understand the issue, but you are right - this doesn''t affect you, so I will move on. To continue with the story, I started experimenting with different settings in my iPhone and through me sticking to it; I was able to get 4G back on! Since there is no one single way to get your problem to magically go away because of too many oddities; Here is a list of things that I did to fix this that may help you:\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<u>For non-jailbreakers:</u>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li>Goto Settings > Turn on / then off Airplane Mode.</li>\r\n    <li>Goto Settings > General > Cellular > Turn Cellular Data on (if it isn''t on).</li>\r\n    <li>Goto Settings > General > Reset > Touch Reset Network Settings.</li>\r\n    <li>Goto Settings > General > Cellular > Turn Enable 3G/4G on (if it isn''t on).</li>\r\n    <li><b>If you have access</b>: Goto Settings > General > Cellular > Cellular Data Network > Scroll down to the bottom and touch Reset Settings. Then reboot your iPhone. (this was what helped me). If you see nothing in your APN Settings, this might be the route to take.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<u>For jailbreakers:</u>\r\n<br />\r\nSome extra things to do if you have a jailbroken iPhone. This can be done after doing the above for non-jailbreakers.\r\n<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Disable all jailbreaks by rebooting the iPhone, holding the + volume button upon the start up.</li>\r\n    <li>Editing the APN Settings. <b>Be careful with this one as you need to get your settings from your provider. Don''t guess at it!</b></li>\r\n    <li>Make sure the toggle for 3G is on in SBSettings. Believe it or not this has solved it.</li>\r\n    <li>You can SSH, or use iFile, to go into the root of your iPhone and replace the Carrier.plist of the ATT_US Directory with the one found in the Unknown Directory.\r\n        <br /><br />\r\n        <u>To do this (about the same for SSH):</u>\r\n        <br />\r\n        Step 1. Open iFile.\r\n        <br /><br />Step 2. Goto to / (root).\r\n        <br /><br />Step 3. Goto to User > Library > Carrier Bundle.bundle.\r\n        <br /><br />Step 4. Go up one directory to iPhone. Find Unknown.bundle and touch it.\r\n        <br /><br />Step 5. Touch the Edit button. Click the carrier.plist file. Touch the lower right icon (the clipboard). Click Copy/Link. \r\n        <br /><br />Step 6. Go back one directory to iPhone. Find ATT_US.bundle. Paste (by clicking on the lower right clipboard button) the file into this folder. <b>NOTE: You might want to backup the old carrier.plist file, just in case.</b>\r\n        <br /><br />Step 7. Reboot your phone.\r\n        <br /><br />Some have had success doing this, I myself tried this and it gave me a "3G" symbol on the top left of my iPhone but no data connection.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIf all else fails you have 2 options:\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li>You can restore your iPhone. Try this one first.</li>\r\n    <li>Take it to Apple and have them fix or replace it.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<b>NOTE: This information was written for AT&T Customers but can be used for other carrier customers. Just replace any mention of AT&T with your carrier.</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Now that you know...</h2>\r\n<p>I hope that this article has proven to be helpful in your quest to fix your broken iPhone. Regardless of what path you take make sure to remember to troubleshoot your issue as much as you can without anyone''s help until you have exhausted all your resources. This way you learn and learning is fun! This goes for pretty much anything in life. Thanks for taking the time to read my intuitive article.

(9, 'OMG!', '2012-09-11 18:15:29', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 'OMG! I have really been busy with this website. The last time you heard anything from me, the coder behind the most amazing website, was when v.2.9 was the version of this website (The WIFE). Well, the WIFE is getting updating to version 3.0 along with this website. I am glad to announce that there are tons of new features to this beautiful website! Shall we start?\r\n[!--more--]\r\nOk! First off, I went out to get a composition (don''t know why) notebook to draw/write my design ideas in, I was able to draw out what I wanted my portfolio to look like, I am going with a Tech/Simple/Colorful Theme, since that speaks to me in many different ways. Next up, I started over-hauling version 2.9 on this site to make room for the new design changes. Then once design set in, I began implementing the necessary code to make the contact form and comment form operational. Let me point out that the contact form is not just a contact-me-only-form. It is a full-blown, operational, PHP ticketing system that checks and balances all ticket traffic that comes in and out of it. Wow! I only wanted to make a contact  form, but instead I got a ticketing system built in to this beautiful website! I guess that is what you get when you mix listening to Dubstep music, sitting in front of a tri-monitor setup computer system, drinking Monster, and coding your portfolio! Anyways, next up in the design implementation of the Launchpad System. I made it more subtle by placing it in a section called the "Toolkit". The Toolkit is a collection up above the navigation area (where it says Nat4an, About, Blog,...) that can change depending on what you set in the props.php page. I also implemented more database variables (called "Globals") that you can use to change so of the aspects of this website. Like on Blog, you can set up what to do on post of comment (IE. Subject to Approval), whether or not to accept HTML, and the rest. Nice feature! What else? Oh yeah! The beautiful Search System that knows all. I implemented this up  at the top that can be turned off from the Globals in the database just a while ago. Go ahead and try it! I dare you. You will be amazed! No it is not a "Custom Search" script like most "Lazy Coders/People" do. I do not believe in using scripts, that other people make, to power my website(s). I believe that doing so like that makes you look cheap and if you were to build the script yourself then it makes you look better.<br /><br />Now there are so exceptions to this rule of mine. <u>Number 1</u>: If the script is something like a library (such as jQuery) then I will use it (because it is a tool that I do not want to "re-invent the wheel" by building it from scratch). <u>Number 2</u>: It has to be a script that I have recently built or it has to be a script that I 100% need to use because I do not know how to build it myself (but even then that is still cheap; if you can''t build it - learn to build it, without re-inventing the wheel of course).<br /><br />Back to the updates, I built the Homepage! It will house everything in the whole site (including other launchpads). The individual launchpads will house everything on that launchpad. I will creating a unique jQuery Slider for the homepage(s) to display/showcase new comments, blog posts, content! I made the comment section of the blog entry posts'' really cool by making them look like you peeled a layer back. :) I still need to fix the botr maker. There seems to be a problem with it duplicating each Month Year the amount of N times how many articles are in the month year combo. Still can''t figure it. That''s pure code that determines what month and year to start and end. It depends on what is in the entries database. One of the best parts about my code. Hard to read, simple in POST. :) Oh I added a "Arr" attribute to the Modules (the things on the right called the "sidebar") that allows you to change it to arrange the modules in any way you want. The idea what I am going to do with this is: when I build the cPanel, when you create a page you can move the modules in to place and it saves the placement to Arr in the database. Don''t know how I''m going to do that but I will take it one step at a time. I also added some spots for Ad rotators. I would like to make a system that rotates the ads and all you have to do is specify what contents to put and where it needs to display. Again, building it on my own to showcase my skillset. Oh, I added some colorful graphics to the About page to go along with the story/content to intrigue the visitors since most of my visiors come to see the About page. I gave the comments form a Moods dropdown so that commentors can specify what mood they are in. That is one feature that I wish most websites had with their comment forms. So if you wish it, so shall it be. Well...I mean why wish others to have something you can build? Hmm...deep. :) Of course the beauty of the Comment System is the ticketing system it has. Yes! My Comment System does have a ticket system. It can be used as a log for you to keep track of the comments you post (since it allows you to search by email) and it is something that allows you to check the status of a comment that is being reviewed. By the way, that setting can be change in the Globals in the database to Approve Immediately, Subject to Approval, or Approve after 24 hours (I haven''t worked in this one yet, but I will find out how I am going to do it). Work page will be worked on later. I plan to make it a titled-layout where it displays projects based on what it is. Idk...I will decide how to do that later. I am burned out. Tired. I am so stoked to see this website get off the ground. I showed it to my friend Sean Casey and he said he liked it, so it looks like I am doing something right. Oh by the way, this website is now SEO with amazing spidey powers!!! I love it. Every page has individual keywords for spiderability! Well...it has been great!

Okay, so that wasn''t as good as what I anticipated but regardless I will keep moving on. This site has not seen any action for a good 3 months (maybe even more) and I am sure it has now seen the action it deserves. Let me be the first to introduce version 3.9, a major release of Nat4an.com and WITLL Framework! This major push comes with over 30 new features/issues fixed and some ideas for re-organization. [!--more--]Let me just dive into the meat of this update:\r\n<ul class="list-circle">\r\n<li>Added a delete cookie session on log out of this site</li>\r\n<li>Added ability to check for same password on change when you forget password</li>\r\n<li>Added a Modal Popup the shows you a social networking reference when you come to the site for the first time.</li>\r\n<li>Fixed the Tempsystem() function. Seems that there were some conflicting objects that were causing havoc.</li>\r\n<li>Fixed some security flaws</li>\r\n<li>Added a Theme Manager (geared and ready to accept new themes) as well as restructured how themes work. This system is now using the world famous SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheet) as a system of placing variables from themes in the main.css file. Oh, I did also move around the locations of the theme assets to a tm-assets folder in the includes/ directory.</li>\r\n<li>Added an ability to check in the users table for including someone (an admin) in the MTS (Modular Ticketing System) as a POC (Point of Contact).</li>\r\n<li>Fixed some email sending defunct-ions.</li>\r\n<li>Added a Sadminium System to the front/construction page to be a better system to managing assets of this site (modes, groundwork for user-ability, etc).</li>\r\n<li>Separated the Testing Server and Remote Server Cookies so that I don''t have confusion on my end when I test and debug. Um...it also doubles as an extra security asset to the site.</li>\r\n<li>Fixed a major security flaw, like real major, when some was logged in and you try to access the user on another computer you can essentially logged them out by typing anything into the password field when it asks for password.</li>\r\n<li>Added a Leave Site button as well as rearranged how the Log out, Leave Site, cPanel, and other buttons display on the site - you now have a drop-down button list thingy that displays theme. Still working on the theme of it.</li>\r\n<li>Fixed the offset of the Front page tweet feed.</li>\r\n<li>Cleaned up the modes/ folder by merging all of the mode files into one mode.php to make it easier to develop by opening one file instead of multiple files.</li>\r\n<li>Added a Report system, much like the Contact system, to the site.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOf course that only skims the surface of all the background updates I have done.  There are more than a handful of detailed updates that I have done to this site (small ones that you won''t even notice - hell I wouldn''t even notice) but rest assure they have been done and you can enjoy a better, faster, smoother website framework.

A Better question would be &quot;who is Nat4an?&quot;. Nat4an is a creative, stunny, professional, determined, motivated, challenged, passionate, and focused individual who focuses on becoming the impossible in web design and other passionate fields he enjoys.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back in the day, which was about around 1998, He began his growth as a young, talented, individual in computers. He has always loved computers to the point of sleeping with them (not in an awkward way...:P). He joined a magnet-middle-school when He was in seventh grade. Excelling was what He did the most. He then got into high school where He joined a beautiful program called DATA (Design and Technology Academy). This high school was no ordinary high school. In fact, it housed  some of the most brilliant individuals in Texas. Yes that is right! He is in the beautiful state of Texas. Proud of it! Anyways, You could say that DATA was like Eureka. A society of teenage-dreamers who wanted to shape and build the world to their liking while receiving the best benefits. He then graduated, after 4 years, and went off to discover and build the new world.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<h2 class="pages-maincontent-title">A Word from Nat4an...</h2>\r\n<div class="pages-maincontent-content">\r\n<div class="pages-maincontent-content-inner">\r\n<p>\r\nHi! I am Nat4an, the creator and founder (President and Head Webmaster) of Nat4an.com. I created this website as a place for me to easily share my intellect with the world as well as create communities in which people can share their intellect amongst their peers.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<b>[WARNING]</b> Currently our site is undergoing routine maintenance in the construction of our new server/website. We are changing this whole enviroment on a day-to-day basis. With that being said if you find a bug or glitch, tell us! That is all for this announcement. <b>[/WARNING]</b>\r\n<br /><br />\r\nMy life has been pretty straight forward with many winding twists and turns that any normal life would have. There is nothing normal about my life. Let''s see...born and raised in San Antonio, TX area. Raised in a Christian home and pretty much forced to go to church (not really) all my life. I LOVE to code! I first took on coding when I got my first ever computer at the age of 12. It was an old Pentium \r\n Computer Chipset, you know the really big white one, and I went biserk with it. I took it apart and put it back together more times than I could count on my fingers (at that age). Wait a minute, I remember waaaaayy back, my grandfather built me this big white box (made out of wood...as if boxes are made out of stone) that had all sorts of lights, switches, buttons, a radio, and circuits. Oh man! That was the best toy I had ever received at the time, especially for a young boy. It lasted for a good 6 years. I was what? 4 or 5 when he made it. Man that was the best.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThen of course back to the basics...I got another computer when I was a freshman in high school. An eMachine computer (for free). My neighbor was throwing it out. I learned DOS on it. Oh right, in DATA my first class, as a freshman, was Intro to Design and Computers or something like that (shows how long it has been since I have been in high school...:P). I earned an achievement in there (Best Achievement in Design Technology, 2005). I quickly became a level 12 Flunky in that class. Sophomore year hit and I started to dive into code with OOP languages such as C++. Then junior year hit and I got into more graphical languages like Java. And then as a Senior I worked on more advanced languages like PHP and Perl, building websites, and making some cool stuff (like video with Final Cut Pro, but that''s not code - so I won''t go into it yet).\r\n<br /><br />\r\nCoding has been apart of me all my life and I continue to use it as I grow. I believe that coding is going to be something that I will ultimately use to build the human race 2.0 (ha...I like dreaming).</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<h2 class="pages-maincontent-title">What do I think about the Web?</h2>\r\n<div class="pages-maincontent-content">\r\n<div class="pages-maincontent-content-inner">\r\n<p>\r\nI think that is a good question for every web designer to answer. I think the web can be both an enhancement and a determinant to society. In one way a webpage or something on the web can help someone, such as a web search for "how to feed a gold fish" can help someone learn how to feed their gold fish. Now on the other hand it can be a determinant because you can say something to someone or about someone and not mean it one way and they could take it the other way which could mess up friendships and relationships. People tend to communicate more on the web than they do in real life to the point that they have lost the art of communication.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nIt use to be that you would have asked, back in the late 90s, "do I need a website?". Now you don''t even think twice about not having a website.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nWhat the web really is, to me that is, is it is an old fashion catalog but digitalized in a sense that everything is compressed together to form a backended, connected system, that anyone can use to look through. Hmm...that really flowed well. :)\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<h2 class="pages-maincontent-title">Making decisions</h2>\r\n<div class="pages-maincontent-content">\r\n<div class="pages-maincontent-content-inner">\r\n<p>\r\nIn my experience, I have always taken the tough route (it seems like). I am a strong believer in the fact that people make "split decisions" based on the "one-two-point". What I mean is people seem to (even me) make decisions based on the moment they do something. For example, if I get in trouble at work for something I would make a decision based on that to quit my job. Those kind of "split decisions" can get someone into trouble and might even make their journey a bit tougher. If I would have (hypothetically) quit my job, I would have kicked myself because I wouldn''t have a job and I would be up a creek without a paddle.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nWhen it came down to making this portfolio, I had to think about a few things:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>What best describes me</li>\r\nand\r\n<li>How can I show the world who I am</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBased on those two "questions", I created this site. I believe that the best thing that would describe me is abstract. I like to be creative and make things (whether it is a cool world in Minecraft or making my own CMS with my own named variables and cool functions :P). How can I show the world who I am? Yikes...that is a tough one. I am going to have to think about that.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nBack to the part about the big white box that had all the lights, sounds, buttons, knobs, and switches on it - for a long time I deeply thought about how I should go about making and designing my portfolio, my own little slice of the web. How should I draw it out? What bests describes me, or my life? Is there a single instance of something that would best fit me? Those questions came to mind when building this website. Then it hit me, like a ton of bricks, I thought about how that big white techy box thing that made me so happy (the one I mentioned earlier) and how my whole life has revolved around techy things so much that I knew, I just had to, build and design my website (my portfolio) with buttons, knobs, switches, and all kinds of things. Make it a techy theme, make it fresh, crisp, have perspective, and make best of all - make it me. After all, this isn''t just a web portfolio; it is my life.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe last thing I would like to leave you with is how this portfolio, and me, fit into the grand scheme of things. I believe that one day I will be a renowned leader in modern technology and I would like to grow and shape things around me. This portfolio serves its purpose of being a collection of the works of me and what I do.

The word is the Japanese abbreviated pronunciation of &quot;animation&quot;. The intended meaning of the term sometimes varies depending on the context. While the earliest known Japanese animation dates to 1917, and many original Japanese animations were produced in the ensuing decades, the characteristic anime style developed in the 1960s - notably with the work of Osamu Tezuka - and became known outside Japan in the 1980s.</p>\r\n    \r\n    <p>Anime, like manga, has a large audience in Japan and recognition throughout the world. Distributors can release anime via television broadcasts, directly to video, or theatrically, as well as online.</p>\r\n    <p>Both hand-drawn and computer-animated anime exist. It is used in television series, films, video, video games, commercials, and internet-based releases, and represents most, if not all, genres of fiction. As the market for anime increased in Japan, it also gained popularity in East and Southeast Asia. Anime is currently popular in many different regions around the world.</p>\r\n    \r\n    <p>Anime began at the start of the 20th century, when Japanese filmmakers experimented with the animation techniques also pioneered in France, Germany, the United States, and Russia. The oldest known anime in existence first screened in 1917 - a two-minute clip of a samurai trying to test a new sword on his target, only to suffer defeat. Early pioneers included Shimokawa Oten, Jun''ichi Kouchi, and Seitar Kitayama.</p>\r\n    \r\n    <p>By the 1930s animation became an alternative format of storytelling to the live-action industry in Japan. But it suffered competition from foreign producers and many animators, such as Nobur fuji and Yasuji Murata still worked in cheaper cutout not cel animation, although with masterful results. Other creators, such as Kenz Masaoka and Mitsuyo Seo, nonetheless made great strides in animation technique, especially with increasing help from a government using animation in education and propaganda. The first talkie anime was Chikara to Onna no Yo no Naka, produced by Masaoka in 1933. The first feature length animated film was Momotaro''s Divine Sea Warriors directed by Seo in 1945 with sponsorship by the Imperial Japanese Navy.</p>\r\n    \r\n    <p>The success of The Walt Disney Company''s 1937 feature film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs influenced Japanese animators. In the 1960s, manga artist and animator Osamu Tezuka adapted and simplified many Disney animation-techniques to reduce costs and to limit the number of frames in productions. He intended this as a temporary measure to allow him to produce material on a tight schedule with inexperienced animation-staff.</p>\r\n    \r\n    <p>The 1970s saw a surge of growth in the popularity of manga - many of them later animated. The work of Osamu Tezuka drew particular attention: he has been called a &quot;legend&quot; and the &quot;god of manga&quot;. His work - and that of other pioneers in the field - inspired characteristics and genres that remain fundamental elements of anime today. The giant robot genre (known as &quot;Mecha&quot; outside Japan), for instance, took shape under Tezuka, developed into the Super Robot genre under Go Nagai and others, and was revolutionized at the end of the decade by Yoshiyuki Tomino who developed the Real Robot genre. Robot anime like the Gundam and The Super Dimension Fortress Macross series became instant classics in the 1980s, and the robot genre of anime is still one of the most common in Japan and worldwide today. In the 1980s, anime became more accepted in the mainstream in Japan (although less than manga), and experienced a boom in production. Following a few successful adaptations of anime in overseas markets in the 1980s, anime gained increased acceptance in those markets in the 1990s and even more at the turn of the 21st century.</p>\r\n    \r\n    <h1>My Own Opinion</h1>\r\n    <p>Now that you witness (or read) an account of what anime is from Wikipedia (or at least some of it) comes the time where I share what I think anime is. Anime is definitely what Wikipedia calls &quot;animation&quot; but to me anime is more than that. Anime has always been, is now, and will always be in the lives of many people.</p>\r\n</div>', '', '', '', '$GET_MODULES=mysql_query("SELECT * FROM {$properties->DB_PREFIX}pages_modules WHERE page=''$page'' AND sidebar=''1'' AND launchpad=''$launchpadPN'' AND status=''Published'' AND toggle_visible=''on'' ORDER BY arr") or die(''uh oh!

If you have only seen an anime in Dub''d (english) then it isn''t as bad.

(Note: some webserver''s have a different method to creating a database, I would recommend consulting with your webserver administration on this.) Once you created the database, click to go into your database (if you haven''t already) and click on "Import". Click the "Choose File" and select the file "mts.sql" (this is the generic baseline for the MTS; you must use this SQL unless you want to recreate the code :)). Once selected click on (on the dialog box) "Open" and then (after it closes) click on "Go". Now we are done with creating the database. We will come back here to add our reasons and staff_types and users for our system.</p><h2>Step 4: Configure the props.php</h2><p>Open up conf/props.php in Notepad or your PHP editing software (Eg. Dreamweaver). You are going to want to change some things. First change the "public $FORM_TITLE" value to the name you want displaying above the MTS. Change the "public $A_EMAIL" to the email you want the autoresponder to send to when someone contacts you. Next go down to a comment that says "//database stuff" and change the "public $DB_HOST", "public $DB_USER", "public $DB_PASS", and "public $DB_NAME" to match your credentials for your database (again consult with your webserver administration on this one). You can also change the "public $DB_PREFIX" value to match your prefix of the tables in your database. This is defaulted to "t_"</p><p>Optional: You can change the "public $COMPANY_NAME" to match your company name (but unless you really want to, please leave it alone to retain ownership information; this item doesn''t necessary get displayed on your form). "public $PLATFORM" is the name of the platform MTS is built on; I made this as my system for creating things; you can change it, but again to retain ownership please leave it. "public $VERSION_CTRL" needs to be left alone to match with the version on our server, you may break it if you change it. Change "public $WEBSITE_NAME" to match your website name (self-explanatory). Change "public $WEBSITE_SLOGAN" to match your slogan, not really being used but will one day be used on MTS. "public $WURL" you don''t need to worry about. Don''t worry about the "public $SITE_DESCRIPTION", "$SITE_AUTHOR" or the "$SITE_KEYWORDS"; those have not been implemented yet. </p><p>And that is all for the conf/props.php file. Save and Close out of that.</p><h2>Step 5: Place contents of index.php</h2><p>Last thing to do is to place the MTS where you want it to display. First open up the index.php in Notepad or your PHP editing software (Eg. Dreamweaver). Now the easiest way to go about doing this is by taking everything inside of "<!-- MTS SYSTEM HEAD -->" and putting it into the <head></head> section of your document. Then take everything inside of "<!-- MTS SYSTEM BODY -->" and place it where ever you want it inside the body.</p><h2>Step 6: Customize the MTS</h2><p>Now that the initial system is setup we need to add our own customized content. Go into your database and first choose "t_reasons" (this step assumes you are using the defaulted "t_" prefix on the table names; if not then in place of "t_" put your prefix), click on "Insert" to insert a new row. Type in the reason name in the "reason" field and leave "rcode" blank since it is AUTO_INCREMENT and it automatically puts an id in it. Don''t worry about "is_searchable", that is a custom code I use on my website to allow things to be searchable by the search. You can put anything in this table. Make it match with what you want people to be able to contact you for. Next go over to "t_staff_types" and as just like the last table we did, enter in the information. This table is for your staff types (hence the name) (Eg. Admin, CEO, etc). Last go over to "t_users", this is an extra given table that you can use to place your users in (your welcome) and is important to MTS as this system gets the user id and puts it into the "Point of Contact?" field/dropdown list. Insert a row on this table just like you normally do. You can change the "type" column to match what your types of users are. Refer to your database instructions on how to do that or google it. Enter the user''s first name (fname), last name (lname), user name (uname), password (upass), type, staff_type (this is the id from your t_staff_types), and poc_code (a representation of an ID; enter what you want (Eg. "4534")). Once done with that, you have now customized the database to fit your needs.</p><h2>Step 6: Enjoy the ease-of-use of MTS!</h2><p>Now that you have setup the entire MTS on your site, you can sit back and relax and enjoy the MTS as it takes in queries from people and sends them to you without you even lifting a finger. Well you have to tend to the queries but that is something even I can''t do for you.</p>', 'yes', 'yes', 'completed', 'yes', 'featured.jpg', 'Published', '2012', '09', '21', '11', '18', '00', 'none', ''),
